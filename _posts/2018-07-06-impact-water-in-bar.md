# ABAQUS Impact bar with half water inside

模拟水的运动和杆上应力变化

## Introduction the main steps

## step1 Create the eulerian part   

 * use the bigger eulerian part to cover the water inside.

## step2 Define the material 
 * define the material of eulerian part

### DO NOT give half-water material
 * Don't worry about the warning about without material when submitting

## step3 Create the discrete Field
 * Choose the bigger eulerian part the then the half-water to define the discrete Field

## step4 Define the general contact
 * Just define it, without the detail property

## step5 Define the Load
 * Define the predefined field and choose the discrete field created.

*******************************************************
### Result discussion and future improve 
 * Compare the result with the bar without water inside, we can see the bar's movement direction changes backward and forward due to the inertia of water movement.
 * The stress wave propagation is also quite different.
